    <h2>My Engineering Leadership Philosophy</h2>

    <h3>1. Focus on the Team, Not Just the Code</h3>
    <p>I’ve learned that the best engineering outcomes happen when people feel comfortable enough to speak up, admit when they’re stuck, and challenge ideas. My job isn't to have all the answers; it’s to build a team where everyone feels safe to do their best work. I focus on "servant leadership"—getting the roadblocks out of the way so the team can actually build.</p>

    <h3>2. Product and Engineering are on the Same Side</h3>
    <p>I don't believe in the old-school way of "throwing requirements over the wall." I want my engineers to understand the <em>why</em> behind what we’re building. I work closely with Product and Design to make sure we’re making smart trade-offs—balancing the need for new features with the long-term stability and health of the platform.</p>

    <h3>3. Speed Comes from Quality</h3>
    <p>There’s a common myth that you have to choose between "going fast" and "doing it right." In my experience, you can't have one without the other. By investing in things like automated testing and solid CI/CD pipelines, we give the team the confidence to ship often. I look at delivery signals—like how long it takes to get code live or how often things break—to help us find where the process is lagging, not to micromanage the people.</p>

    <h3>4. Mentorship is the Best Part of the Job</h3>
    <p>The highlight of my career hasn't been the projects I’ve shipped, but the people I’ve helped move into senior and lead roles. I’m big on regular 1:1s, honest feedback, and finding "stretch" opportunities for the team. If I’m doing my job right, the team becomes more self-sufficient every day.</p>
